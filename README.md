### Detailed Requirements

#### 1. Kubernetes Resource Management Tools
- **Functionality**: Develop tools to automate common Kubernetes tasks, such as deploying applications, managing resources, and monitoring pod status.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Integrate with Kubernetes API using client-go or similar libraries.
  - Create functions for deploying, updating, and deleting pods, services, and other Kubernetes resources.
  - Implement error handling and validation checks.

#### 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- **Functionality**: Develop a CLI to interact with Kubernetes clusters, execute commands, and display results.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Use a package like Cobra for building the CLI.
  - Ensure commands are intuitive and well-documented.
  - Implement features like auto-completion and argument parsing.

#### 3. Web Interface (Optional)
- **Functionality**: Build a basic web interface for visual management of Kubernetes resources.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Use a Go web framework for the backend.
  - Design a simple and intuitive UI.
  - Implement real-time updates and interactive components using WebSockets or AJAX.

#### 4. Scalability and Load Balancing Features
- **Functionality**: Automate scaling of applications and manage load balancing.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Integrate Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) functionalities.
  - Provide commands or interface options for adjusting scaling parameters.
  - Consider implementing custom metrics for more advanced scaling.

#### 5. Logs and Metrics Viewer
- **Functionality**: Provide capabilities to view and analyze logs and metrics of Kubernetes resources.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Fetch logs from pods and display them in the CLI or web interface.
  - Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus for metrics.
  - Include options for filtering and searching within logs.

#### 6. Compatibility and Testing
- **Functionality**: Ensure compatibility with the latest version of Kubernetes and include tests.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Test against multiple Kubernetes versions.
  - Write unit tests for API interactions and tool functionalities.
  - Consider setting up a minikube or kind environment for integration testing.

#### 7. Documentation
- **Requirements**: Provide comprehensive documentation, including installation, configuration, and usage instructions.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Document each command and its options.
  - Include examples and use cases.
  - Provide an architectural overview and design rationale.

#### 8. Deployment Scripts and Templates
- **Functionality**: Offer scripts or templates for easy deployment of GoKubeTool.
- **Implementation Tips**:
  - Provide Dockerfiles and Kubernetes YAML files for deploying the tool.
  - Include instructions for deploying in different cloud environments.
  - Ensure scripts are well-documented and tested.

### Additional Considerations

- **User Experience**: Focus on making the tools intuitive and easy to use.
- **Security**: Implement secure communication with Kubernetes clusters and handle sensitive data appropriately.
- **Extensibility**: Design the toolset with extensibility in mind for future enhancements or plugins.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for performance, especially in handling large Kubernetes environments.
