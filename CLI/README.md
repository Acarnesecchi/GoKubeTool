### 2: Command-Line Interface (CLI)
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive and user-friendly CLI in Go for managing Kubernetes resources, providing intuitive command structures and clear output for various operations.

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Basic CLI Structure**:
   - **Functionality**: Develop the foundational structure of the CLI.
   - **Features**:
     - Implement a main command with subcommands for different Kubernetes resources (e.g., `devtools pods`, `devtools deploy`).
     - Provide a help command to display usage instructions for each subcommand.
   - **Implementation Tips**:
     - Utilize a CLI framework like Cobra in Go for managing commands, arguments, and flags.
     - Organize the command structure logically, grouping related operations.

2. **Interactive Command Execution**:
   - **Functionality**: Design the CLI for interactive usage with real-time feedback.
   - **Features**:
     - Execute commands with immediate feedback on the operation's success or failure.
     - Provide detailed error messages and suggestions for troubleshooting.
   - **Implementation Tips**:
     - Handle different types of errors gracefully and provide user-friendly output.
     - Implement verbose and quiet modes for different levels of output detail.

3. **Advanced Command Features**:
   - **Functionality**: Include advanced features for complex operations.
   - **Features**:
     - Implement batch operations for handling multiple resources.
     - Provide filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities for resource listings.
     - Support custom scripts or commands for extended functionalities.
   - **Implementation Tips**:
     - Allow integration with external scripts or tools for extended functionality.
     - Ensure robustness in handling large datasets and complex queries.

4. **Integration with Kubernetes API**:
   - **Functionality**: Ensure seamless integration with the Kubernetes API.
   - **Features**:
     - Provide commands that directly interact with the Kubernetes API to manage resources.
     - Handle authentication and authorization with Kubernetes clusters.
   - **Implementation Tips**:
     - Use client-go or similar libraries for Kubernetes API interactions.
     - Implement robust authentication mechanisms, supporting various Kubernetes setups.
