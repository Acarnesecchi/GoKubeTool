### 1: Kubernetes Resource Management Tools
**Objective**: Develop a set of tools in Go that facilitate efficient and effective management of Kubernetes resources, including pods, deployments, services, and more.

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Pod Management**:
   - **Functionality**: Tools to create, update, delete, and monitor the status of pods.
   - **Features**:
     - Create pods from custom or existing templates.
     - Update pod configurations, such as resource limits and environment variables.
     - Delete pods safely with options to handle dependent resources.
     - Monitor real-time status, including health, resource usage, and restarts.
   - **Implementation Tips**:
     - Utilize client-go library for Kubernetes API interactions.
     - Implement logic to handle pod lifecycle events and error states.

2. **Deployment and Service Management**:
   - **Functionality**: Tools for handling Kubernetes deployments and services, including scaling and versioning.
   - **Features**:
     - Deploy applications with customizable configurations.
     - Scale deployments up or down based on user input or automated rules.
     - Update deployments with new versions and manage rollback procedures.
     - Create and modify service objects to expose applications.
   - **Implementation Tips**:
     - Implement rollout and rollback strategies for deployments.
     - Use Kubernetes services and Ingress for external access configurations.

3. **Resource Monitoring and Reporting**:
   - **Functionality**: Tools to monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) and generate reports.
   - **Features**:
     - Display current resource usage of pods and nodes.
     - Generate historical reports on resource utilization.
     - Alert users on resource limits or abnormal usage patterns.
   - **Implementation Tips**:
     - Integrate with metrics-server or similar tools for resource metrics.
     - Develop a reporting mechanism, possibly with data export options.
